# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This example demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript: handling null or undefined values. The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers, but if either input is null, it returns 0 to avoid errors.  This is a basic, yet effective way to handle potential null values and make your code more robust.
